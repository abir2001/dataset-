During the event, students were also screened and referred, where necessary, for BMI, Tobacco use, and depression (PHQ-9).

• BMI screening closed gaps in Weight Assessment and Counseling for Nutrition and Physical Activity for Children/Adolescents care.
	○ 2,200 students were found to have elevated BMI scored. These students were received diet and nutritional counseling and were referred back to their PCP.
• Students who had positive screenings for tobacco use received counseling and were referred back to their PCP
• Approximately 175 students were found to have suicidal thoughts. These students were immediately connected to a behavioral health professional and information was referred back to their PCP.

Goodside helps maximize school time for children as 36% of the sick tele-visits encountered by Goodside resulted in the student returning back to class.

Pregnant individuals in the United States experience adverse maternal and birth outcomes at rates greater than those in nearly all other developed nations. The U.S. maternal mortality rate in 2019 was 20.1 deaths per 100,000 live births, an increase from 17.4 in the previous year. Nationally, approximately 700 women die annually from pregnancy or related complications. Approximately 60% of those deaths are preventable. Rates of pregnancy-related mortality are two to three times higher among black women (40.8 per 100,000). For every maternal death, more than 100 women experience severe maternal morbidity (SMM). Significant health disparities exist in maternal health, driven by race/ethnicity, geographic location, and socio-economic status. Women with SMM are more likely to be poor, older, delivered by cesarean, black, and enrolled in Medicaid.

",Care Management,"This C&S care model brings together Medicaid (TANF/CHIP), DSNP, Maternity, and LTSS into a fully integrated care model. This NCQA and DSNP MOC compliant innovative model uses a POD team approach to provide intense care management to the top 1% of impactable members, while leveraging provider engagement and vendor partnerships to drive condition specific management and gap closure.  The attached diagram depicts how this care model will work together across populations.

In this new clinical model, all members are stratified into three tiers:
Tier 1 members are our highest complexity (Top 1%) and will be prioritized for POD assignment. These members will receive high-touch engagement as they are considered most complex, highest-cost impactable members. Interventions are delivered through multi-specialty professional POD care teams within the Health Plan.
Tier 2 members are considered our Emerging Risk population (Top ~ 2-3%) requiring chronic condition management or transitional management. These members will receive intervention-based engagement aligned with acute, “trigger- initiated” and program-specific ID/strat. Interventions are delivered through local or national programs as appropriate. Strategic partnerships may be available through targeted solution design.
Tier 3 members are the majority of our members that require care gap closure or outreach based on contractual requirements. These members will receive interventions specific to initiatives focused on quality gap closure or as per contractual requirements by market. Tier 3 programs can be both national and local based on opportunity and scope.","To ensure that members are uniquely identified for the support services needed, all members will receive a Health Risk Assessment (HRA) that will be scored via UHC’s proprietary risk algorithm
UHC will assign members to a diverse team of care managers based on the results of the HRA, who will further support leveraging clinical providers to address the holistic needs of each member
By leveraging UHC’s differentiated services and supports that are tailored to specific populations’ (e.g., extended care management for high-risk post partum members, SCYP, network access specialists for LTSS populations), care managers will refer members to appropriate services based on needs identified from the HRA and clinical team
UHC recruits a diverse set of care coordination team members to support the unique needs of key NM populations (e.g., Native Americans, LTSS, members with BH needs, maternity)
To ensure that unmet social needs are being addressed through care coordination, UHC will hire specific care management supports (e.g., FTEs for CISC, SDoH Navigator, Housing Nav., Employment/Education Nav., Justice-Involved Nav., Native American Nav.) to connect members to culturally appropriate wrap-around services
UHC will proactively identify members whose spiritual distress exacerbates health issues by hiring spiritual support coordinators focused primarily on adults/LTSS and maternity/family populations",All members,"Using this transition of care model, we continue to decrease readmission rates even after years in the state. In our Texas STAR program, we decreased 30-day readmission rates from 13.71% in 2019 to 12.32% in 2020. In Kansas, we decreased readmission rates from 9.14% in 2019 to 8.92% in 2020.
Costs
This is based on how many staff are needed to manage the 1%, based on pre-determined caseloads by population, and by the national and local interventions being deployed for the state.

Err:522,Roadrunner food bank ,Roadrunner food bank  (RFP Cat. #183),Committed,Linda Atencio,,Southern NM,Drew Peterson,,Other,Roadrunner is currently in the planning stages for launching Healthy Foods Express (HFE) Mobile Markets in southern NM. We recently purchased a building in Las Cruces that will serve as a base for the HFE mobile markets and are in the process of preparing it for occupancy. We have also begun discussions with potential partners for the HFE mobile markets.  ,"The Childhood Hunger Initiative in Roswell and the Healthy Foods Express Mobile Markets will be continued; however, they may require more funding if supply chain issues and inflation continue to cause Roadrunner’s operating costs to rise. The most significant impact has been on our food and fleet costs. Roadrunner works with manufacturers, growers, and wholesalers to coordinate the donation or low-cost purchase of food. Whether food is donated or purchased, Roadrunner incurs expenses to safely transport the food to our warehouse in Albuquerque. Supply chain disruptions and inflation have caused a decline in the availability of donated food, as well as an increase in the cost to transport any donated food to our 
warehouse. In addition, federal funding for food has declined precipitously. Roadrunner must now purchase more food to compensate for lower levels of federally funded as well as privately donated food, while food prices, even with Roadrunner’s volume and discounted pricing, have continued to increase. The costs to operate our fleet of refrigerated tractor trailers and box trucks that deliver food from our warehouse to our food distribution sites have also increased significantly",All,"“[The program] has been a blessing for the families of Sunset Elementary School. The families all know when the truck
gets here and to line up. We have seen these parents for years, especially if they have a couple of kids in this school.
The children I think are the ones that benefit from this more because sometimes parents cannot afford the veggies or
the fruit that they receive. I am thankful that I have very loyal volunteers that are with me every month, if it wasn’t for
their help we would not have been able to have done this for this long. And also the funding that we get from United
Healthcare is what keeps this going for these families. Families are so happy to see the truck coming and us there. Some
even have my phone number -- don’t know how that happened but word of mouth spreads fast -- for that we are
grateful because all the food is distributed at this school. This would not have been possible if not for United Healthcare.

Once award is granted, they will do a ROI analysis to determine where they can add the most value",Tracy Tonwsend,,Care Management,"Reema’s mission is to transform the way people navigate the gaps between social care and health care by employing a mix of technology and in-person community guides (similar to CHWs) to outreach and locate members. If our traditional outreach attempts to engage the members are unsuccessful, we deploy Reema, a community-based solution to locate and engage members. Barriers from prior engagement can often be due to an underlying behavioral health need or gaps in social needs.","Through our advanced technology platform, predict and identify the needs of our members. Reema knows  how to engage the most challenging members through text messaging, phone calls, and home visits.
Each member engagement is facilitated by one of  Reema’s Guides, people from the community who have shared identity.
Reema has demonstrated successful engagement of 84% of a population with substance use disorder, opioid use disorder or severe mental illness previously not engaged by care coordinators. Once the trust is established, the Reema community guides make recommendations and introductions to our team for eligible programs.
-	If after our traditional outreach attempts to engage in CM (phone call, etc.), we deploy a community-based solution to locate and engage those that are unengaged with CM
-	Typically the barrier from prior engagement is a BH condition as well as gaps in social needs
-	Reema develops a relationship (non-clinical) to build trust and address those gaps. 
-	Community guides (their staff) are hired from within the community (understand the system, challenges) – also hits on health equity.
-	The trust built in the relationship is transferred to the health plan, example: UHC has a really great program where a nurse comes to your home (House Calls). Would you like me help you schedule that?
How do we make sure they’re ready
We have a national partnership established with Reema. Preparation for implementation in a market includes two critical components: Recruiting and hiring locally based community guides and effective membership file sharing. The following will determine readiness for implementation:
•	Implementation meetings – Our program lead will meet with Reema at least weekly in preparation for the implementation. This will ensure effective and coordinated planning efforts.
•	Membership File exchange – We are currently and effectively exchanging membership files in other states where Reema is serving UHC members. We will utilize the same file layout for Indiana and will conduct file exchange testing a minimum of 90 days in advance of the implementation date. In addition to ensuring effective data sharing, this file will support Reema’s hiring of the community guides.
•	Community Guide staffing – Reema has experience entering new geographic areas and has a proven recruitment and hiring process. This process includes advertising and recruiting efforts in the needed geographic areas. Community Guides will be hired a minimum of 30 days prior to the implementation date to allow for adequate training and building of relationships with community based resources.
To ensure effective management of the program, we have established a robust monitoring program that includes a regular cadence of meetings and program reports including:
•	Routine (minimum monthly once scaled, but weekly for 60 days pre and post-implementation. These meetings include reporting and discussion of:
o	Engagement rate
o	Engagement by zip code
o	SMS Opt-in rate
o	Program disenrollment and reason
o	Identified Member Needs, Resources Connected and Needs Addressed
o	Member stories (randomly selected by UHC)

•	Quarterly Joint Operating Committee meeting to review the results, trends, opportunities and a selection of member stories. 

Additional reports and meetings will be developed as needed.",All,"[From Reema Brochure] REEMA successfully engaged over 84% of this population, resulting in:
